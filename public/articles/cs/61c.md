Dan Garcia is the man. Personally, I don't think I've ever had a better lecturer.

Though some of the course material is incredibly interesting, a lot of the topics could be mind-numbingly boring if it weren't for how **hype** Dan Garcia gets about them. His genuine excitement over topics like assembly code, machine language, and the MIPS datapath is contagious and you can't help but feel excited with him. He also goes out of his way to make sure that students viewing the webcasts have an awesome experience as well. Couldn't ask for a better video lecturer.

Lecture videos are solid and the textbook is pretty easy to follow. However, the MIPS datapath lectures can be tough to follow from static slides and textbook pages -- I found it much easier to absorb the information when watching a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVu4ukOL3_j1PNZ2DLbVIZw">step-by-step walkthrough</a> by YouTuber Quinn Lu. Homework assignments are presented clearly but Labs are always going to be difficult without help from a TA/GSI or peers to discuss with...

While I want to give this course 5/5 stars for usefulness because of the exposure to **"Great Ideas in Computer Architecture"**, I'm going to have to tone it down to 2.5/5 to emphasize the relative importance of 61A and 61B.

Unless you work on embedded systems or are trying to reverse engineer software, this course isn't going to help you much in your day to day. Most of the topics covered involve under the hood processes that modern languages typically handle for you. 

Although it's not an argument I would make, I think it's arguable to be a completely competent and productive software engineer today without any of the knowledge from this course.

For those that are curious about how your computer takes your beautiful code, compiles it into 1's and 0's, and somehow understands your intentions enough to return an expected response, this course is for you. For those that can appreciate learning timelesss lessons from computer architecture and design, this course is also for you.

Coming from a student of 61A and 61B, this course connects all of the dots under the hood that give life to the code you've been writing. Specifically, you learn to read and write C, assembly code, and even machine code (yeah, you literally learn to read and write 1's and 0's that a computer can understand). At a more general level, this course revolves around **"6 Great Ideas in Computer Architecture"** and serves as an introduction and foundation to many upper-division CS courses (Operating Systems, Compilers, Networking, Databases, etc..)

**6 Great Ideas of Computer Architecture:**

1.  **1) Layers of Representation / Interpretation**
    -  The importance of modular levels of abstraction and the implementation of the abstraction layers in modern computer architecture.

2.  **2) Moore's Law**
    -  The number of transistors in a dense itegrated circuit was predicted to double every ~2 years. However, with power and heat management unable to keep up with the density of transistors, the current trend is towards utilizing more processors per chip rather than increasing transistor capacity.

3.  **3) Memory Hierarchy / Principle of Locality**
    - The exploitation of temporal and spacial locality to exaggerate the amount of available physical resources that a computer uses via caches and buffers.

4.  **4) Parallelism and Pipelining**
    - The rampant exploitation of parallelization and pipelining to optimize processes at every level of computing from the datapath, to threads, to processes, to distributed computing via mapreduce. Also, the importance of Amdahl's law and the limitations of parallelization.

5.  **5) Performance Measurement & Improvement**
    - The importance of understanding underlying hardware to optimize application latency and throughput.

6.  **6) Dependability via Redundancy**
    - Modularity and system design in which one failing piece will not make the entire system fail.

7.  **7) (Bonus) Making the Common Case Fast**
    - Enhancing overall performance by focusing on improving the common case rather than edge cases.

These ideas aren't at all mutually exclusive -- most of the ideas overlap each other in some way, but they are each coherent and comprehensible as individual concepts. The biggest takeaways of the entire course for me were definitely the design and implementation of the memory hierarchy and the ubiquitious exploitation of parallelism. Although I can't see myself writing assembly code ever again, exposure to these ideas have definitely given me new perspective to solve some of the problems that I face as a software engineer. 

**Conclusion**
---
Overall, this was my second favorite course of the 61 series (61A being my favorite). While it's arguably not the most practical for my day to day job, the course material was incredibly interesting and I've even been told that I get pretty hype when explaining some of the concepts to friends (Cheers, Professor Garcia). Most importantly, this course builds a foundation for some of the cooler upper division courses.

I fully recommend this course to the curious software engineer, not so much for the practical programmer.
