Sleeping Better (5 Tips)
=====
In the two years I spent working in a sleep lab, whenever I was asked "What do you do?", the next question was almost always "How can I sleep better?" 

This wasn't really a surprise -- sleep research has exploded in the past few decades and has shown that better sleep can benefit mental performance, physical aesthetics, overall health, mood, and sex. **For one reason or another, everyone can find some benefit in sleeping better. **

The following five tips are the most helpful tips I've learned from my time as a student of sleep, sleep researcher/lecturer, and sleep "advisor."

**1) Association**
-----
"Your bed is a sanctuary for sleep, and sleep only.. and sex." I distinctly remember the laughter in the lecture hall when Dr. Allison Harvey added the caveat. The additional advice of having sex in your beds isn't to benefit your sleep, it is moreso that it "isn't reasonable to ask adults to not have sex in their beds."

Forget the sex caveat -- more importantly, the key idea is to avoid associating your bed with any stimulating activity. The power of association is often underestimated. I've found that people who come to me asking for help with their sleep often play video games in bed, use their laptops in bed, or have overly-aggressive pillow fights. If these activities become a habit, your mind will start to associate your place of sleep with the stimulation and this will make it harder for your mind to relax and ultimately fall asleep.

**2) Worry Cycle**
-----
For those of you that are "sleep-enlightened" and value the quantity of sleep you get, this is directed at you. 

It's 2:00AM. I have to get up at 8:00AM. I can get a whole 6 hours of sleep! OK!

    *Check Phone* It's 2:20AM. Ok, 5 hours and 40 minutes of sleep!

    *Check Phone* It's 2:45AM.. I need these 5 hours and 15 minutes..

    *Check Phone* It's 3:30AM.. Ugh maybe I'll skip class today..

This is a topic in anxiety called the **Worry Cycle**. Constantly worrying about how much sleep you're able to get will keep you from relaxing, and ultimately keep you from getting sleep! 

The simple solution is to break the cycle completely. This can be done by turning your alarm clock around, placing your phone out of reach, and accepting that thinking about the amount of sleep you'll get that night will not increase the amount of sleep you'll get that night.

**3) Lighting**
-----
The most influential external factor of sleep is **LIGHT**. The mere presence of light triggers a cascade of activity from your eyes to your brain to every corner of your body. To sum things up, the presence of light inhibits the production of *melatonin*, the hormone that is responsible for drowsiness (darkness -> sleepy).

If the previous tips weren't enough to convince you, hopefully this will be the nail in the coffin. **Keep your cell phones and laptops out of your bed, especially at night!** Checking your cell phone in bed is similar to telling your brain the sun is rising and it's time to wake up!

There has been some research on the effects of different wavelengths of light on drowsiness -- it was found that blue light is the biggest culprit. I'd recommend this cool tool: [flux](https://justgetflux.com/). As it gets later into the night, your screen will gradually adjust it's lighting to a warmer red (and lessen blue light).

**4) Exercise**
-----
As if you didn't already have a reason to exercise. 

Interestingly, better sleep results in increased energy and testosterone for exercise (gainz), while daily excercise results in deeper sleep (delta sleep), where human growth hormone is released (gainz). AKA gainz on gainz. Thomas Gainsborough won't have \*\*\*\* on you.

Exercise. Sleep better. Exercise better.

**5) Regulate**
-----
In tip 3, I mentioned that the most influential *external* factor of sleep was light. The #1 most influential factor of your sleep is your **circadian rhythm**.

Researchers found that when people deprive themselves of day/night cues such as sunlight and traffic (by living in underground caves for an extended period of time), their bodily functions continue to operate rhythmically on cycles of a little more than ~24 hours.

*To sleep better tomorrow night, the best thing you can do is to sleep well tonight.*

Although this is the most influential factor in sleeping well, I've listed it at the bottom because it is the most difficult to follow. There are two types of people in this world, people who can't keep perfect sleep schedules and liars.

**P.S.**
