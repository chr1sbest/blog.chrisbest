**History**
---
Studied psychology at UC Berkeley while researching sleep and memory consolidation in Matt Walker's Lab. Being the zealous academic that I am, I took every opportunity to apply my lab's research during lectures.

**Although, I prefer the term "memory consolidation sessions" > "naps"**

After graduating, I worked a couple of lame jobs and eventually realized I wanted to be a software engineer. I found a few brilliant mentors, left my job to teach myself computer science & web development full-time, co-founded a startup, left when the money ran out, studied for a month to [close the gap](articles/coding/closing-the-gap), and now I'm working again as a full-time as a backend software engineer.

**Learning Computer Science**

Here you will find my reviews and supplemental resources for courses that I have audited to learn computer science. These resources have been tremendously helpful, enlightening, and 100% free. Hopefully other motivated autodidacts can find these posts useful!

**Topics in Coding**

General topics in coding, mostly with Python.

**Topics in Psychology**

A bachelor's degree from an established University, although labelled "irrelevant" to my trade, is not something I am ashamed of. The knowledge gained from the courses I took as a Psychology major have changed my life for the better and shaped me into a happy, tolerant, and confident individual. I want to write articles on some of the more interesting and relatable aspects of human nature.
