About me
---
Studied psychology at UC Berkeley while researching sleep and memory consolidation in Matt Walker's Lab. Being the zealous academic that I am, I took every opportunity to apply my lab's research during lectures.

**I prefer the term "memory consolidation sessions" > "naps"**

After graduating, I worked a couple jobs and eventually realized I wanted to be a software engineer. I found a few brilliant mentors, left my job to teach myself computer science & web development full-time, co-founded a startup, left when the money ran out, studied for a month, and now I'm currently interviewing.

**Adventures of a Self-Taught Developer**

I want to write articles to give perspective on being a self-taught developer and help guide other self-taught developers to learn from my mistakes and triumphs.

**Topics in Psychology**

A bachelor's degree from an established University, although labelled "irrelevant" to my trade, is not something I am ashamed of. The knowledge gained from the courses I took as a Psychology major have changed my life for the better and shaped me into a happy, tolerant, and confident individual. I want to write articles on some of the more interesting and relatable aspects of human nature.
