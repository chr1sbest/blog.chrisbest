**History**
---
I studied psychology at UC Berkeley while researching sleep and memory consolidation in *Matt Walker's Sleep and Neuroimaging Laboratory*. As a zealous academic, I took every opportunity to apply my lab's research during lectures.

**Although, I prefer the term "memory consolidation sessions" > "naps"**

After graduating, I worked a couple of lame jobs and eventually realized I wanted to be a software engineer. I found a few brilliant mentors, left my job to teach myself computer science & web development full-time, co-founded a startup, left when the money ran out, studied for a month to [close the gap](articles/coding/closing-the-gap), and now I'm working again full-time as a backend software engineer.
